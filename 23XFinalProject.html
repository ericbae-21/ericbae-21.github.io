  <h1>A Brief History of Central Asian Jews: Iron Age Enigma</h1>
  <h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    Little historical or anthropological literature exists on the history of Central Asian Jews or their culture. Central Asian Jews, more frequently called Bukharian or Bukharan Jews, are an ethno-religious Jewish subgroup from Central Asia. Hailing from Uzbek cities such as Bukhara, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Margilan, as well as Tajik cities like Dushanbe, Bukharian Jews are united by a common Judeo-Tajik dialect: Bukhori. Only in the decades following the dissolution of the Soviet Union have scholars begun to dedicate serious attention to documenting Bukharian language, oral history, and traditions. Further, the most robust data on this ethno-religious community come from 19th and 20th century reports by Western historiographers and Soviet Orientalists, both of whom were far less interested in modern standards of historical analysis and more interested in adding to longstanding tropes of the removed, exotic peoples of Central Asia.

    In this webpage, I hope to divulge some of the history of this fascinating community. Sadly, my ancestors' iron age history has long been obscured, both by the vicissitudes of contending civilizations but also by an antiquarian historian's sad reality: records are either ill-kept and shrouded away beyond our reach or altogether do not exist. A direct answer, at least at the moment, to the question of Bukharian Jewish provenance is impossible. A direct answer may one day appear, or never at all. As with many areas of historical study, we are left with traces. Travellers' accounts and second hand sources, policies and persecutions, archaeological sites and artifacts -- this is the addicting nectar from which we will try to recreate our patron flower. Occasionally, we may find a fallen petal in the form of direct record or original writing. If we do, we may consider ourselves lucky. But, for now, sit yourselves down with a refreshing cup of jasmine tea, and allow me to tell you that which I have gathered over the course of years.
