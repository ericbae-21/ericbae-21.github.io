  <h1>A Brief History of Central Asian Jews: Iron Age Enigma</h1>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    Little historical or anthropological literature exists on the history of Central Asian Jews or their culture. Central Asian Jews, more frequently called Bukharian or Bukharan Jews, are an ethno-religious Jewish subgroup from Central Asia. Hailing from Uzbek cities such as Bukhara, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Margilan, as well as Tajik cities like Dushanbe, Bukharian Jews are united by a common Judeo-Tajik dialect: Bukhori. Only in the decades following the dissolution of the Soviet Union have scholars begun to dedicate serious attention to documenting Bukharian language, oral history, and traditions. Further, the most robust data on this ethno-religious community come from 19th and 20th century reports by Western historiographers and Soviet Orientalists, both of whom were far less interested in modern standards of historical analysis and more interested in adding to longstanding tropes of the removed, exotic peoples of Central Asia.1 It is difficult to concisely express how pervasive the works of modern-era historiographers Abraham Ya'ari and Robert Zand are, and more talented scholars than I have committed themselves to such an undertaking (Professor Alanna Cooper, being the foremost scholar).

    In this webpage, I hope to divulge some of the history of this fascinating community. Sadly, my ancestors' iron age history has long been obscured, both by the vicissitudes of contending civilizations but also by an antiquarian historian's sad reality: records are either ill-kept and shrouded away beyond our reach or altogether do not exist. A direct answer, at least at the moment, to the question of Bukharian Jewish provenance is impossible. A direct answer may one day appear, or never at all. As with many areas of historical study, we are left with traces. Travellers' accounts and second hand sources, policies and persecutions, archaeological sites and artifacts -- this is the addicting nectar from which we will try to recreate our patron flower. Occasionally, we may find a fallen petal in the form of direct record or original writing. If we do, we may consider ourselves lucky.

    But, for now, sit yourselves down with a refreshing cup of jasmine tea, and allow me to tell you that which I have gathered over the course of years.

<h3>Chapter 1: Posing Questions and Defining Medieval Identity</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    Before attempting to piece together the possible historical origins for the Jews of Central Asia, it is necessary to historically contextualize the concept of identity. Identity, in its modern sense, can bear an individual and a collective meaning. On the individual level, identity, encompassing a set of values and beliefs, takes on deeply personal and reflexive qualities. A group of individuals with shared a shared set of values can form a collective identity, something akin to nationality or culture. Identity in medieval Eurasia, however, was not internally derived. Rather, to the state, it reflected class, title, rank, profession, ethnicity, and area of origin and was primarily used for bureaucratic function.2 In communities, your identity could determine your social obligations or economic duty. In other words, identity in medieval Eurasia bore pragmatic administrative and social utility, and several states reserved the power to objectify identity and legally oversee identity negotiations to rule their empires and levy taxes more efficiently.3 The substantiation of identity at the state level enabled Khans and their successors to balance competing regional interests by brokering support to different identity factions.4
</p>
  <p id="Body">
  The increased politicization of identity would, overtime, intimate the beginnings of nationalism. Perhaps more importantly, this system of identity reflected fundamental differences in medieval attitudes toward the self. Europeans and Asians of the Middle Ages did not perceive themselves as free-born citizens of distinct individual worth, but instead as a part of the general scheme of things.5 There existed emperors and serfs, sultans and dervishes, popes and heretics, Mongols and sarts, and the rich and the poor.6 So, too, existed the Jews. As a Jew, one generally accepted the divine ordinance and state ordinance and asked few questions.7 In the context of tracing the activity of Bukharian or Central Asian Jews more broadly, these realities carry consequences. Sources will likely reflect weak associations between Jews and their state authority. For example, a hypothetical text from the Timurid Empire may reference Jews of Bukhara or Jews of Samarkand, but they will not collectively refer to them as Timurid Jews.8 They are Jews, foremost, followed by their region and perhaps economic niche. When, why, and how Central Asian Jews came to be called Bukharian Jews is thus an open question.
</p>
  <p id="Body">
  Somewhere in between state substantiated identity and individual notions of identity lies religious identity. Despite claiming to be all one people, Jewish communities fractured and dispersed, changing with time and different environments. Centers of religious authority like Babylon and Baghdad spearheaded philosophical debates and asserted religious norms over their periphery. To what extent the different Jewish peoples of Central Asia felt or remained connected to these authorities as they travelled the continent sheds light on the validity of the narrative of Bukharian isolation.

  <h3>Chapter 2: Dispersion; Jewish Arrival in Central Asia</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    While evidence of Jewish settlement in Central Asia is sparse in the first few centuries AD, there are direct links between the Babylonian Jewry, the Persian Jewry, and the Jewry of Central Asia. The first Jews to arrive in Central Asia were likely those whom the Babylonians exiled from the Land of Israel in 586 BC.9  After the Persians conquered the Babylonians in the early 5th century, Jews were permitted to return, but many likely chose not to.10  Some spread out from Babylonia into Iran, most likely as merchants moving along overland trade routes, while others moved farther east toward Afghanistan and northeast into Transoxiana, then ruled by Persian Achaemenids. 
    </p>
  <p id="Body">
    The first indicators of Jewish settlement in Transoxiana come from a 4th century AD Babylonian Talmud story, “<em>Avodah Zara,</em>” from Pumbedita.11 Pumbedita was an ancient city located near the modern-day city of Fallujah, Iraq, and quite an influential one. The story describes how Semu’el bar Bisena, an amora or authority on Judaic law, doubts the ritual cleanliness of Jews living in Merv and refuses to drink their alcohol. Some Jewish studies scholars have interpreted this as strong evidence for Jewish presence in the Merv Oasis even earlier than the 4th century AD.12  Bar Bisena’s suspicions of insufficient knowledge of Judaic rituals in Merv imply that a substantial Jewish settlement had existed in Transoxiana for several generations, or at least long enough for an amora from Babylon to recognize the population there. A second source from the 6th century AD, Šahrestānīhā-ye Ērānšahr, shows evidence of Jewish settlements even farther north in Transoxiana. The source claims that the capital of Khorezm, Kath, was founded by Narseh, the son of a Jew, perhaps in an attempt to explain the presence of Jews in Khorezm.13  The most robust evidence for an enduring Jewish presence in Central Asia comes from a series of archaeological discoveries in Merv dating back to the 2nd or 3rd century AD.  These discoveries include objects with Hebrew inscriptions, dishes, and ossuaries from the 5th and 6th centuries AD.14 They also include Khorezmian coins from the first half of the 8th century with an Aramaic font and strong Hebrew features to record Khorezmian, a language in the East Iranian subgroup.16
    </p>
  <p id="Body">
    As it stands, it appears that Jewish settlement existed in Transoxiana prior to the Arab conquests of Central Asia in the first two decades of the 8th century. Crucially, these Jewish settlements retained Persian or Judeo-Persian as their language of choice, which is further evinced by the writings of 10th century chronicler Nathan the Babylonian.17 When religious issues arose in Khorasan province (which includes Khorezm), Khorasanian Jews would defer to the opinions of Jewish scholars in Baghdad.18 Nathan the Babylonian also mentions a controversy between the Bagdhadi Exilarch and Gaon, the Jewish political leader and Jewish religious leader, respectively, over the distribution of revenues received from the Khorasanian Jews.19 Jewish scholar Alanna Cooper interprets these two points to conclude that 10th century Jews in Central Asian paid taxes to Jewish institutions like the Pumpedita Academy in Baghdad and considered themselves tied to the religious decisions made there.20 Coupled with a Hebrew-influenced Aramaic in Khorezm, the dialogue between Jews of Baghdad and Khorasan may indicate that Judeo-Persian remained the dominant language among Jews throughout the Middle East and Central Asia well into the 11th century, even influencing Muslim and Turkic conventions.

  <h3>Chapter 3: Peaceful Coexistence and the Khazar Question</h3>

  <p id="Body">
    The centuries after the Umayyad invasion into Central Asia in the 7th and 8th century AD provide a slightly more detailed portrait of Jewish activity and history in Transoxiana. According to a 739 AD report by the scholar al-Tabari, the administrations of Muslim confessional states had already conferred Jews (as well as Christians and even Zoroastrians, at that point) their status as <em>ahl al-dhimma.</em>21 In return for enduring certain discriminatory measures and tax payments, Jews acquired a degree of tolerance and protection within the empire.22 Alongside practicing their religion, Jews could travel throughout Persia and Central Asia relatively unrestricted through overland routes as merchants and artisans.23 As one author summarized, “the anti-Jewish suras of the Koran contained dangerous tinder for fanaticism, but for a long time that tinder
seldom kindled.”24
  </p>
    <p id="Body">
      We can glean that Jewish populations were well tolerated under nomadic regimes as well, since Judaism was a recognized minority religion equal in rights to any other faith in Asia.25 Of course, a discussion on Judaism among nomadic polities cannot be had without discussing the controversial Khazar Khaganate. A powerful kingdom situated on the banks of the Volga and the Caspian, the Khazar Khaganate became one of medieval Eurasia’s foremost economies out of Gokturk territory.26 The details surrounding the Khazar nobility’s conversion to Judaism and the dissolution of the Khazar Khaganate remains a provocative issue among scholars that cannot be discussed in full here.
    </p>
    <p id="Body">
      Most historians accept that the ruling nobles of the polyglottic empire adopted rabbinic Judaism, though the date of this conversion, sometime between 730 AD and 861AD, depends on the source analyzed.27 The most persuasive evidence lies in a Hebrew letter of Khazarian origin called the “Cambridge Document” from around 949 AD.28 The letter describes Khazar Jews arriving from three locations in either chronological or quantitative order: Baghdad, Khorasan, and Greek territories.29 One scholar, in analyzing the letter, concluded that the document was not a translation from a different language and that it retained Persian fragments in its terminology and linguistic structure.30 This further supports the idea that Judeo-Persian endured to 11th century Transoxiana, linking the Jewish populations of the continent and potentially even serving as the Jewish Khazar’s written language. As for the cause of this conversion, the ruling caste’s adoption of Rabbinic Judaism in the wake of Muslim and Christian pressures most likely hints at greater economic and political factors influencing 8th century geopolitics.31 For our purposes, I will emphasize three points as they relate to Khazaria. First, the Kingdom of Khazaria was located just north of Khorasan. Second, Khazaria was one of the key buffer states between the Christian West and the Muslim and Chinese East.32 Third, the Khazar nobles converted to Judaism not out of religious exercise, but out of some perceived economic or political benefit either domestically or geopolitically.
