  <h1 class="text-element" id="title">A Brief History of Central Asian Jews: Iron Age Enigma</h1>
  <h3 class="text-element" id="chapter">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    Little historical or anthropological literature exists on the history of Central Asian Jews or their culture. Central Asian Jews, more frequently called Bukharian or Bukharan Jews, are an ethno-religious Jewish subgroup from Central Asia. Hailing from Uzbek cities such as Bukhara, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Margilan, as well as Tajik cities like Dushanbe, Bukharian Jews are united by a common Judeo-Tajik dialect: Bukhori. Only in the decades following the dissolution of the Soviet Union have scholars begun to dedicate serious attention to documenting Bukharian language, oral history, and traditions. Further, the most robust data on this ethno-religious community come from 19th and 20th century reports by Western historiographers and Soviet Orientalists, both of whom were far less interested in modern standards of historical analysis and more interested in adding to longstanding tropes of the removed, exotic peoples of Central Asia.<sup id="note">1</sup> It is difficult to concisely express how pervasive the works of modern-era historiographers Abraham Ya'ari and Robert Zand are. That said, more talented and better travelled scholars than I have committed themselves to such an undertaking, and so I consign the topic to their expertise. 
</p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    In this webpage, I hope to divulge some of the history of this fascinating community. Sadly, my ancestors' Iron Age history has long been obscured, both by the vicissitudes of contending civilizations but also by an antiquarian historian's sad reality: records are either ill-kept and shrouded away beyond our reach or altogether do not exist. A direct answer, at least at the moment, to the question of Bukharian Jewish provenance is impossible. A direct answer may one day appear, or never at all. As with many areas of historical study, we are left with traces. Travellers' accounts and second hand sources, policies and persecutions, archaeological sites and artifacts —- this is the addicting nectar from which we will try to recreate our patron flower. Occasionally, we may find a fallen petal in the form of direct record or original writing. If we do, we may consider ourselves lucky. 
</p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    But, for now, sit yourselves down with a refreshing cup of jasmine tea, and allow me to tell you that which I have gathered over the course of years.
  </p>

<h3 class="text-element" id="chapter">Chapter 1: Posing Questions and Defining Medieval Identity</h3>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    Before attempting to piece together the possible historical origins for the Jews of Central Asia, it is necessary to historically contextualize the concept of identity. Identity, in its modern sense, can bear an individual and a collective meaning. On the individual level, identity, encompassing a set of values and beliefs, takes on deeply personal and reflexive qualities. A group of individuals with shared a shared set of values can form a collective identity, something akin to nationality or culture. Identity in medieval Eurasia, however, was not internally derived. Rather, to the state, it reflected class, title, rank, profession, ethnicity, and area of origin and was primarily used for bureaucratic function.<sup id="note">2</sup> In communities, your identity could determine your social obligations or economic duty. In other words, identity in medieval Eurasia bore pragmatic administrative and social utility, and several states reserved the power to objectify identity and legally oversee identity negotiations to rule their empires and levy taxes more efficiently.<sup id="note">3</sup> The substantiation of identity at the state level enabled Khans and their successors to balance competing regional interests by brokering support to different identity factions.<sup id="note">4</sup>
</p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
  The increased politicization of identity would, overtime, intimate the beginnings of nationalism. Perhaps more importantly, this system of identity reflected fundamental differences in medieval attitudes toward the self. Europeans and Asians of the Middle Ages did not perceive themselves as free-born citizens of distinct individual worth, but instead as a part of the general scheme of things.<sup id="note">5</sup> There existed emperors and serfs, sultans and dervishes, popes and heretics, Mongols and sarts, and the rich and the poor.<sup id="note">6</sup> So, too, existed the Jews. As a Jew, one generally accepted the divine ordinance and state ordinance and asked few questions.<sup id="note">7</sup> In the context of tracing the activity of Bukharian or Central Asian Jews more broadly, these realities carry consequences. Sources will likely reflect weak associations between Jews and their state authority. For example, a hypothetical text from the Timurid Empire may reference Jews of Bukhara or Jews of Samarkand, but they will not collectively refer to them as Timurid Jews.<sup id="note">8</sup> They are Jews, foremost, followed by their region and perhaps economic niche. When, why, and how Central Asian Jews came to be called Bukharian Jews is thus an open question.
</p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
  Somewhere in between state substantiated identity and individual notions of identity lies religious identity. Despite claiming to be all one people, Jewish communities fractured and dispersed, changing with time and different environments. Centers of religious authority like Babylon and Baghdad spearheaded philosophical debates and asserted religious norms over their periphery. To what extent the different Jewish peoples of Central Asia felt or remained connected to these authorities as they travelled the continent sheds light on the validity of the narrative of Bukharian isolation.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-element">Chapter 2: Dispersion; Jewish Arrival in Central Asia</h3>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    While evidence of Jewish settlement in Central Asia is sparse in the first few centuries AD, there are direct links between the Babylonian Jewry, the Persian Jewry, and the Jewry of Central Asia. The first Jews to arrive in Central Asia were likely those whom the Babylonians exiled from the Land of Israel in 586 BC.<sup id="note">9</sup>  After the Persians conquered the Babylonians in the early 5th century, Jews were permitted to return, but many likely chose not to.<sup id="note">10</sup>  Some spread out from Babylonia into Iran, most likely as merchants moving along overland trade routes, while others moved farther east toward Afghanistan and northeast into Transoxiana, then ruled by Persian Achaemenids. 
    </p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    The first indicators of Jewish settlement in Transoxiana come from a 4th century AD Babylonian Talmud story, “<em>Avodah Zara,</em>” from Pumbedita.<sup id="note">11</sup> Pumbedita was an ancient city located near the modern-day city of Fallujah, Iraq, and quite an influential one. The story describes how Semu’el bar Bisena, an amora or authority on Judaic law, doubts the ritual cleanliness of Jews living in Merv and refuses to drink their alcohol. Some Jewish studies scholars have interpreted this as strong evidence for Jewish presence in the Merv Oasis even earlier than the 4th century AD.<sup id="note">12</sup>  Bar Bisena’s suspicions of insufficient knowledge of Judaic rituals in Merv imply that a substantial Jewish settlement had existed in Transoxiana for several generations, or at least long enough for an amora from Babylon to recognize the population there. A second source from the 6th century AD, Šahrestānīhā-ye Ērānšahr, shows evidence of Jewish settlements even farther north in Transoxiana. The source claims that the capital of Khorezm, Kath, was founded by Narseh, the son of a Jew, perhaps in an attempt to explain the presence of Jews in Khorezm.<sup id="note">13</sup> The most robust evidence for an enduring Jewish presence in Central Asia comes from a series of archaeological discoveries in Merv dating back to the 2nd or 3rd century AD.<sup id="note">14</sup> These discoveries include objects with Hebrew inscriptions, dishes, and ossuaries from the 5th and 6th centuries AD.<sup id="note">15</sup> They also include Khorezmian coins from the first half of the 8th century with an Aramaic font and strong Hebrew features to record Khorezmian, a language in the East Iranian subgroup.<sup id="note">16</sup>
    </p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    As it stands, it appears that Jewish settlement existed in Transoxiana prior to the Arab conquests of Central Asia in the first two decades of the 8th century. Crucially, these Jewish settlements retained Persian or Judeo-Persian as their language of choice, which is further evinced by the writings of 10th century chronicler Nathan the Babylonian.<sup id="note">17</sup> When religious issues arose in Khorasan province (which includes Khorezm), Khorasanian Jews would defer to the opinions of Jewish scholars in Baghdad.<sup id="note">18</sup> Nathan the Babylonian also mentions a controversy between the Bagdhadi Exilarch and Gaon, the Jewish political leader and Jewish religious leader, respectively, over the distribution of revenues received from the Khorasanian Jews.<sup id="note">19</sup> Jewish scholar Alanna Cooper interprets these two points to conclude that 10th century Jews in Central Asian paid taxes to Jewish institutions like the Pumpedita Academy in Baghdad and considered themselves tied to the religious decisions made there.<sup id="note">20</sup> Coupled with a Hebrew-influenced Aramaic in Khorezm, the dialogue between Jews of Baghdad and Khorasan may indicate that Judeo-Persian remained the dominant language among Jews throughout the Middle East and Central Asia well into the 11th century, even influencing Muslim and Turkic conventions.

  <!-- Ok, here in this section between one of tha paragraphs I likely want a map of the ancient world that shows where Pumbedita was as well as where Merv is. -->

  <h3 class="text-element" id="chapter">Chapter 3: Peaceful Coexistence and the Khazar Question</h3>

  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    The centuries after the Umayyad invasion into Central Asia in the 7th and 8th century AD provide a slightly more detailed portrait of Jewish activity and history in Transoxiana. According to a 739 AD report by the scholar al-Tabari, the administrations of Muslim confessional states had already conferred Jews (as well as Christians and even Zoroastrians, at that point) their status as <em>ahl al-dhimma.</em><sup id="note">21</sup> In return for enduring certain discriminatory measures and tax payments, Jews acquired a degree of tolerance and protection within the empire.<sup id="note">22</sup> Alongside practicing their religion, Jews could travel throughout Persia and Central Asia relatively unrestricted through overland routes as merchants and artisans.<sup id="note">23</sup> As one author summarized, “the anti-Jewish suras of the Koran contained dangerous tinder for fanaticism, but for a long time that tinder
seldom kindled.”<sup id="note">24</sup>
  </p>
    <p class="text-element" id="Body">
      We can glean that Jewish populations were well tolerated under nomadic regimes as well, since Judaism was a recognized minority religion equal in rights to any other faith in Asia.<sup id="note">25</sup> Of course, a discussion on Judaism among nomadic polities cannot be had without discussing the controversial Khazar Khaganate. A powerful kingdom situated on the banks of the Volga and the Caspian, the Khazar Khaganate became one of medieval Eurasia’s foremost economies out of Gokturk territory.<sup id="note">26</sup> The details surrounding the Khazar nobility’s conversion to Judaism and the dissolution of the Khazar Khaganate remains a provocative issue among scholars that cannot be discussed in full here.
    </p>
    <p class="text-element" id="Body">
      Most historians accept that the ruling nobles of the polyglottic empire adopted rabbinic Judaism, though the date of this conversion, sometime between 730 AD and 861AD, depends on the source analyzed.<sup id="note">27</sup> The most persuasive evidence lies in a Hebrew letter of Khazarian origin called the “Cambridge Document” from around 949 AD.<sup id="note">28</sup> The letter describes Khazar Jews arriving from three locations in either chronological or quantitative order: Baghdad, Khorasan, and Greek territories.<sup id="note">29</sup> One scholar, in analyzing the letter, concluded that the document was not a translation from a different language and that it retained Persian fragments in its terminology and linguistic structure.<sup id="note">30</sup> This further supports the idea that Judeo-Persian endured to 11th century Transoxiana, linking the Jewish populations of the continent and potentially even serving as the Jewish Khazar’s written language. As for the cause of this conversion, the ruling caste’s adoption of Rabbinic Judaism in the wake of Muslim and Christian pressures most likely hints at greater economic and political factors influencing 8th century geopolitics.<sup id="note">31</sup> For our purposes, I will emphasize three points as they relate to Khazaria. First, the Kingdom of Khazaria was located just north of Khorasan. Second, Khazaria was one of the key buffer states between the Christian West and the Muslim and Chinese East.<sup id="note">32</sup> Third, the Khazar nobles converted to Judaism not out of religious exercise, but out of some perceived economic or political benefit either domestically or geopolitically. 
    </p>
    <p id="Body">
      The presence of a Jewish state (or state idiosyncratically amicable toward Jews) near Khorasan would have offered a haven for Jews fleeing the Muslim Caliphate’s war against Transoxiana. For Arabs, this was a defining war, an “epoch-making event,” even if their holdings in the region were then tenuous.<sup id="note">33</sup> The Syr Darya river created a natural political and racial frontier between the sedentary Iranians and the nomadic Mongoloids.<sup id="note">34</sup> By crossing this frontier, the Umayyads initiated the first direct ethnic and religious challenge between Arabs and the Turks. Following the invasion, the Arabs immediately began the Islamification of Transoxiana by destroying idols and Buddhist temples in Bukhara, Samarkand, and Balkh.<sup id="note">35</sup> One can reasonably suspect that Jews from Khorezm and the rest of Khorasan, particularly religious leaders, fled north to Khazaria to avoid Qutayba’s hostility. Their geographic proximity to Khazaria and the state’s pre-existing Jewish settlement would have made Khazaria logical, if not attractive, choice for Jewish emigration during this war.
    </p>
    <p class="text-element" id="Body">
      And yet, there appear to be no testimonies from Arab geographers or mentions in Jewish-Khazarian correspondence of significant Jewish movement into Khazaria from this time period.<sup id="note">36</sup> Only one 16th century Jewish historian, Joseph haKohen, cites in his report <em>Emeq ha-Bakha</em> that Persia’s defeat by the Arabs in 690 as the cause for migration of Jews from Persia into Rus and Germany.<sup id="note">37</sup> A 10th century scholar, Al-Masudi, posited that Jews arrived in Khazaria from all Muslim countries and Byzantium, though he only mentions the Byzantine Jews as having left to escape persecution.<sup id="note">38</sup> We can safely assume that Jewish groups from this time faced minimal persecution or political pressures from Qutayba’s conquest. Thus, Jewish populations probably remained dispersed throughout Persia and Central Asia up until at least the 11th century, making use of robust lines of communication through overland routes and a shared Judeo-Persian language.
    </p>

  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    Khazaria’s position just north of Khorasan and at a major artery of commerce between Byzantium, the Kievan Rus’, the Islamic Caliphate, and China left Central Asian Jews in a relatively advantageous position. Controlling the entire north coast of the Black Sea, the Khazar Khaganate profited from the taxation of good carried through overland trade routes.<sup id="note">39</sup> Moreover, religious tensions between Arabs, Turks, and European Christians from the 8th century onward could have provided Jewish merchants an economic niche as merchants and go-betweens. When the Khazhars converted to Judaism, avoiding political entanglements that could come with adopting Islam or Christianity, they probably bolstered the role of the Jewish merchant class. Cautious historians warn against following the stereotype that Jews along the Silk Routes were all merchants, especially when considering the lack of evidence for Jews of Samarkand, the Merv Oasis, or Bukhara contributing to the caravan trade with China in the first millennium AD.<sup id="note">40</sup> However, it is worth noting, as one author states, that, in stark contrast to the Christian West, “the East did not view trade as a shameful occupation, and therefore no ethnic group was disdainful of it.”<sup id="note">41</sup> The movement of goods and currency was, as mentioned before, the lifeblood of medieval empires. Whereas competitive commercial niches and additional tax burdens in Muslim states hindered Jewish merchants, Khazaria offered a comparatively open and lucrative economic terrain.</p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    With such scant evidence, it is impossible to say what proportion of Jewish populations differentiated into which economic sectors. Unsurprisingly, scholars must operate primarily on conjecture. Most historians suggest quite vaguely that Jews along the Silk Routes largely occupied trade, commerce, and medicine.<sup id="note">42</sup> What is clear is that the caravan trade at this time was led through Khorezm, not Bukhara or Samarkand, which are not mentioned in any documents from the time of the Khazars. That said, given Jewish status as <em>ahl al-dhimma</em> and evidence that Judeo-Persian was widespread throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, a Jewish merchant class from multiple cities may have had higher degrees of mobility through Khorasan, Khazaria, and Persia than expected. A business-letter written in Judeo-Persian from the end of the 8th century supports this hypothesis.<sup id="note">43</sup> Written by a Jewish merchant of either Khazaria or Khorezm, the letter was found in West China, describing a merchant that bartered clothing with local Turks.<sup id="note">44</sup> Locals referred to these Jewish merchants as Radhaniya, Persian for “those who know the way,” signaling the dominance of Persian among the Arabic, Greek, French, Andalusian, and Slavic which these merchants likely spoke.<sup id="note">45</sup> This is significant both for the breadth of regular trade achieved by Jewish merchants on these trade routes and for the impressive linguistic continuity of Judeo-Persian throughout the continent. So, while not all Jewish settlements along trade routes evince a prominent Jewish merchant class, the economic and political power of Khazaria would have provided the ideal economic and political conditions for Jewish merchants to trade competitively between the East and the West.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-element" id="chapter">Chapter 4: Central Asian Jews Under the Mongols and the Timurids</h3>
 <p class="text-element" id="Body">There is little evidence for when the first Jews settled in Samarkand and Bukhara. They probably migrated there from Khazaria, Khorezm, and the Merv Oasis sometime between the 10th and 11th centuries AD. According to local tradition and oral history, Central Asian Jews erected the first synagogue in Bukhara in the 8th century AD, although there is no evidence for this.<sup id="note">46</sup> The earliest documentation of Jews in Samarkand comes from 11th century letters that found their way into the Cairo Geniza, according to one modern historian.<sup id="note">47</sup> Accounts from Benjamin of Teluda’s travels through the Middle East in 1170 AD report some 50,000 Jews in Samarkand as well as a <em>nāsī</em> (elder of the community) named Obadiah.<sup id="note">48</sup> Such a figure means that the Jewish population in Samarkand would have rivalled or outnumbered that of Baghdad; Benjamin either exaggerated his account or historians mistranslated his diary entries. Given the difficulty of translating Hebrew and the fact that Benjamin certainly did not visit Samarkand himself, both options are plausible. As historian Michael Shterenshis notes, with the Hebrew language, “8,000 can become 80,000 and 'learned men' can be changed into 'rich men.'”<sup id="note">49</sup> Regardless, the grandiosity of this figure can be attested by the publication and translation of several 12th century books in Samarkand that pay considerable attention to Jewish custom, arrival in Samarkand from China, and Islamic laws surrounding <em>al-Kitabi</em> or “people of the Book.”<sup id="note">50</sup> Bukhara is not mentioned in the accounts of Benjamin of Teluda, and though one source, a 14th century Hebrew-Persian dictionary links Jews near the city of Bukhara.<sup id="note">51</sup></p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">Again, the Jews of Bukhara and Samarkand sparsely appear in the written records of the 13th and 14th centuries. Some historians assume that, in 1220, Jewish quarters suffered alongside other populations when the Mongols conquered Samarkand, besieged Bukhara for 15 days, and enslaved many of its inhabitants. Historian Albert Kaganovitch mentions a written source that reports the sufi Abū’l Karamal-Dārānī ordering and carrying out a large-scale massacre of Bukharian Jews and Christians as early as 1240 AD.<sup id="note">52</sup> Once again, there is sparse evidence of Samarkandian Jews or Bukharian Jews being killed by Mongols. After the Mongol conquests of Central Asia, there is no evidence for continuous Mongolic persecutions of Jews up through the rule of Tamerlane. Jewish populations in Persia, Khorezm, and various Chinese cities like Kaifeng were well established from the 10th to the 13th centuries.<sup id="note">53</sup> Thus, Jews dwelled peacefully in the Turkic composite culture facilitated by Ilkhan rule and continued to travel between the East and the West.<sup id="note">54</sup> Additionally, a peculiar medieval travel book called <em>Mandeville’s Travels</em> from 1357 mentioned Jews near Bukhara in one chapter, alongside mention of Jews in Khorasan, Khorezm, Samarkand, and Turkmeniya.<sup id="note">55</sup> Oral histories from present-day Bukharian Jews claim that Jewish communities fled the Mongol conquests and returned in the late 14th century with Timur, who transferred silk artisans from Persia into his capital.<sup id="note">56</sup> The veracity of this claim is dubious, though the writings of Ibn-Battuta support the notion that the Chagatay Khan Buzan permitted Christians and Jews to rebuild their temples in the mid-14th century after some great past massacre.<sup id="note">57</sup></p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">Historians have written volumes on the centuries of Turkic occupation of Central Asia following the fall of Khazaria. Historian Michael Shterenshis dedicated an entire volume to the topic of Jewish populations under Tamerlane and the Timurids. He concludes that a lack of evidence demonstrating either prosperity or persecution of Central Asian Jews may be taken at face value relatively unproblematically: “One fact is certain from the current sources of knowledge. Timur never issued any anti-Jewish orders, laws or restrictions. Timur never oppressed the Jews for being Jews. Also, the Uzbek anti-Semitic folklore does not exist.”<sup id="note">58</sup> As for why we lack Central Asian Jews in court documents or historiography, a potential explanation could be the general prohibition of court historians to mention Jews in their writings. Particularly throughout the rule of Tamerlane, historiographic etiquette prevented Muslim court historians from referring to Jews, particularly when the writing subject was their ideal monarch.<sup id="note">59</sup> While this does not account for personal documents or letters, an aversion to writing about Jews could partially explain the lack of evidence. If Jewish populations in Central Asia truly did decrease for a time, war, plague, and changing economic conditions could have influenced their numbers and movements.</p>

  <h3 class="text-element" id="chapter">Chapter 5: Entering the Pre-Modern Era; Disappearance and the Beginnings of Modern Memory</h3>
   <p class="text-element" id="Body">
     Thus far, we have primarily discussed the general history of Jewish arrival in
Transoxiana and how they most likely came to occupy Bukhara and Samarkand from the Merv
Oasis, Khorasan, and Khorezm. Their preservation of Judeo-Persian, unrestricted access to
overland trade routes, and general safety under different Eurasian empires allowed for an
interconnectedness among the Eurasian Jewish populations that could hardly be framed as
isolated or remote. Even still, we have only touched upon the history of “Bukharian” Jews, the Jews occupying the major cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, or their language. This is because, in the 16th century, this narrative of a connected population of Jews in Central Asia begins to fall apart.
   </p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    By the second half of the 15th century, a well-established and well-educated Jewish population occupied Bukhara, the center of regional trade and soon to be capital of the future Khanate of Bukhara.<sup id="note">60</sup> Religious publications from numerous learned men, Yakov, Elkanan Cohen Bar Eliezer, and Uziel Moshe Ben-David, in the form of Hebrew poetry, Persian poetry, and copies of religious texts underscore both a healthy learned population and an increase in the Bukharian Jewish population.<sup id="note">61</sup> In addition to these publications, records of the Rabbi, Ovadia, and his familial relationship to Yakov is well documented.<sup id="note">62</sup> These would be the last records of Jewish presence in Bukhara until 1590. For nearly a full century, Jews were absent from the historical record of Bukhara.<sup id="note">63</sup> The English traveler Anthony Jenksinson, who documented the state of the Bukharian economy in the late 1550s, confirmed the absence of Jews in the capital.<sup id="note">64</sup> In his entries, he refuted the commonly held hypothesis that the Mongols were descended from the ten lost tribes, meaning, had he seen Jews in Bukhara, he would have documented his encounters.<sup id="note">65</sup>
  </p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    The fate of these missing Jewish peoples is unknown. Present-day historian Kaganovitch puts forth evidence from the chronicler Hafiz-e Tanysh Bukhari, who wrote that the Uzbek Khan Mohammad Shaibani “was engaged in a holy war against the infidels and rebels, and exerted efforts to drive out the enemies of the faith.”<sup id="note">66</sup> Because the chronicler’s records are vague, it is difficult to say with certainty who he meant. As Kagavonitch states, the “enemies of faith” could have been Shiites as well as Jews.<sup id="note">67</sup> In all likelihood, the Bukharian Jews, unable to escape Bukhara, either converted to Islam or died during the Khan’s violent ascent to power. Jenkinson’s reports depict the routes into Bukhara from the West and out of Bukhara toward the east as poorly secured and filled with bandits and thieves.<sup id="note">68</sup> Overland trade routes already fell out of favor by the 16th century for sea routes and were therefore relegated to regional commerce. As a result, the Jewish commercial niche in the economy shrank, likely forcing more Central Asian Jews to become artisans (of silk goods). Without a large regional power to secure overland routes, the safety of these roads deteriorated, both explaining Jenkinson’s observations and possibly making Jewish flight from Bukhara dangerous.
  </p>
  <p class="text-element" id="Body">
    By the turn of the 17th century, a whole new Jewish quarter was erected in Bukhara and literature from the time reflected a Jewish population in the city.<sup id="note">69</sup> Poetry and other publications from half a dozen Bukharian writers clearly traced a Judeo-Persian literary tradition, raising questions as to the geographic origins of this new Jewish population.<sup id="note">70</sup> Judeo-Persian manuscripts were copied in Bukhara in 1590, 1663, 1666, 1696, 1725, 1771, 1775, 1778, 1781, and 1797, strongly supporting the presence of many learned men in the capital city. More importantly, these copies illustrate a late linguistic transition from Judeo-Persian to Judeo-Tajik, likely reflecting the late migration of this new population of Bukharian Jews.<sup id="note">71</sup> Abdallah Khan of the Shaybanid dynasty most likely forcefully relocated part of the Jewish population from Khorasanian cities, perhaps Mashad or Nishipur, to Bukhara at the end of the 16th century.<sup id="note">72</sup> Such a deportation would have displaced the Jewish weavers, damaging the Persian silk economy and benefiting the Shaybanids in their struggle against the Persians.<sup id="note">73</sup> 19th century documentation of Bukharian legends seems to support this hypothesis, as Scotsman Alexander Bernes, travelling through Bukhara in 1831, was informed that Jews had settled there from Mashhad.<sup id="note">74</sup> British journalist Joachim Hayward Stocqueler reported the same information in 1848.<sup id="note">75</sup>
