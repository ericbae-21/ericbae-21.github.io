  <h1>A Brief History of Central Asian Jews: Iron Age Enigma</h1>
  <h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    Little historical or anthropological literature exists on the history of Central Asian Jews or their culture. Central Asian Jews, more frequently called Bukharian or Bukharan Jews, are an ethno-religious Jewish subgroup from Central Asia. Hailing from Uzbek cities such as Bukhara, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Margilan, as well as Tajik cities like Dushanbe, Bukharian Jews are united by a common Judeo-Tajik dialect: Bukhori. Only in the decades following the dissolution of the Soviet Union have scholars begun to dedicate serious attention to documenting Bukharian language, oral history, and traditions. Further, the most robust data on this ethno-religious community come from 19th and 20th century reports by Western historiographers and Soviet Orientalists, both of whom were far less interested in modern standards of historical analysis and more interested in adding to longstanding tropes of the removed, exotic peoples of Central Asia.1 It is difficult to concisely express how pervasive the works of modern-era historiographers Abraham Ya'ari and Robert Zand are, and more talented scholars than I have committed themselves to such an undertaking (Professor Alanna Cooper, being the foremost scholar). 
</br>
    In this webpage, I hope to divulge some of the history of this fascinating community. Sadly, my ancestors' iron age history has long been obscured, both by the vicissitudes of contending civilizations but also by an antiquarian historian's sad reality: records are either ill-kept and shrouded away beyond our reach or altogether do not exist. A direct answer, at least at the moment, to the question of Bukharian Jewish provenance is impossible. A direct answer may one day appear, or never at all. As with many areas of historical study, we are left with traces. Travellers' accounts and second hand sources, policies and persecutions, archaeological sites and artifacts -- this is the addicting nectar from which we will try to recreate our patron flower. Occasionally, we may find a fallen petal in the form of direct record or original writing. If we do, we may consider ourselves lucky. 
</br>
    But, for now, sit yourselves down with a refreshing cup of jasmine tea, and allow me to tell you that which I have gathered over the course of years.

<h3>Chapter 2: Posing Questions and Defining Medieval Identity</h3>
  <p id="Body">
    Before attempting to piece together the possible historical origins for the Jews of Central Asia, it is necessary to historically contextualize the concept of identity. Identity, in its modern sense, can bear an individual and a collective meaning. On the individual level, identity, encompassing a set of values and beliefs, takes on deeply personal and reflexive qualities. A group of individuals with shared a shared set of values can form a collective identity, something akin to nationality or culture. Identity in medieval Eurasia, however, was not internally derived. Rather, to the state, it reflected class, title, rank, profession, ethnicity, and area of origin and was primarily used for bureaucratic function.2 In communities, your identity could determine your social obligations or economic duty. In other words, identity in medieval Eurasia bore pragmatic administrative and social utility, and several states reserved the power to objectify identity and legally oversee identity negotiations to rule their empires and levy taxes more efficiently.3 The substantiation of identity at the state level enabled Khans and their successors to balance competing regional interests by brokering support to different identity factions.4
</br>
  The increased politicization of identity would, overtime, intimate the beginnings of nationalism. Perhaps more importantly, this system of identity reflected fundamental differences in medieval attitudes toward the self. Europeans and Asians of the Middle Ages did not perceive themselves as free-born citizens of distinct individual worth, but instead as a part of the general scheme of things.5 There existed emperors and serfs, sultans and dervishes, popes and heretics, Mongols and sarts, and the rich and the poor.6 So, too, existed the Jews. As a Jew, one generally accepted the divine ordinance and state ordinance and asked few questions.7 In the context of tracing the activity of Bukharian or Central Asian Jews more broadly, these realities carry consequences. Sources will likely reflect weak associations between Jews and their state authority. For example, a hypothetical text from the Timurid Empire may reference Jews of Bukhara or Jews of Samarkand, but they will not collectively refer to them as Timurid Jews.8 They are Jews, foremost, followed by their region and perhaps economic niche. When, why, and how Central Asian Jews came to be called Bukharian Jews is thus an open question.
</br>
  Somewhere in between state substantiated identity and individual notions of identity lies religious identity. Despite claiming to be all one people, Jewish communities fractured and dispersed, changing with time and different environments. Centers of religious authority like Babylon and Baghdad spearheaded philosophical debates and asserted religious norms over their periphery. To what extent the different Jewish peoples of Central Asia felt or remained connected to these authorities as they travelled the continent sheds light on the validity of the narrative of Bukharian isolation.
