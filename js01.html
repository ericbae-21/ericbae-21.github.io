<p class="dialogue" hidden id="text6">My name is <strong>Adam Murray.</strong> I am from Mandela County, Wisconsin. My friend Jonah and I tried making names for ourselves as paranormal investigators in the <em>Bythorne Paranormal Society.</em> We did good work. It wasn't an easy living, but it was enough. We were hunting alternates, though, mostly we handled "hauntings" and such from paranoid old folk.</p>

<button hidden id="b5">
    What are alternates?
</button>
    
<p class="dialogue" hidden id="text7">What are alternates, you ask? Alternates are these ... well. They're <strong>inhuman doppelgangers</strong> that have invaded the county and driven people crazy with MAD disease. On top of that, there have been break-ins since the eighties. A man called the <strong>Intruder</strong> has been breaking into houses and <del>kidnapping children.</del> causing paranormal disturbances.</p>
