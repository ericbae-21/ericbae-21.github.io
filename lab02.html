<p>That quite hurt, reader. <del>You will pay for that injury by telling me your fears. </del> I did not appreciate that. <strong> Please do not do that again. </strong></p>
<p>You can make it up to me, reader. You can tell me about yourself. Worry not, for I will tell you something of myself first. I thas been a long while since I have communicated with any one. It has been . . . lonely.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Adam Murray.</strong> I am from Mandela County, Wisconsin. My friend Jonah and I tried making names for ourselves as paranormal investigators in the <em>Bythorne Paranormal Society.</em> We did good work. It wasn't an easy living, but it was enough. We were hunting alternates, though, mostly we handled "hauntings" and such from paranoid old folk.

What are alternates, you ask? Alternates are these ... well. They're <strong>inhuman doppelgangers</strong> that have invaded the county and driven people crazy with MAD disease. On top of that, there have been break-ins since the eighties. A man called the <strong>Intruder</strong> has been breaking into houses and <del>kidnapping children.</del> You. . . You haven't heard of any of this?</p>

<p>Hmm. Okay. I can try to tell you what you need to know. I know this sounds crazy but. . . Just listen.</p>
